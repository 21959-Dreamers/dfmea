# DFMEA Management Tool for FTC Team 21959
[中文版本](#dfmea-管理工具--ftc-21959队)

## Overview
This web-based DFMEA (Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) management tool is designed specifically for FTC Team 21959 to systematically analyze potential failure modes in robotics design and implementation. The tool helps the team identify and prioritize potential design risks before they occur, ensuring more reliable and efficient robot performance during competitions.

## What is DFMEA?
Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (DFMEA) is a systematic method developed by the U.S. military in the 1940s and later adopted by NASA and the automotive industry. For FTC robotics, DFMEA helps answer critical questions:

- What might go wrong with our robot's design?
- What are the consequences of specific component failures?
- How obvious will the failure be during competition?
- How can we detect failures during testing?
- How can we prevent failures before they impact our performance?

### Risk Priority Number (RPN) Calculation
The RPN is calculated using three factors:

```
RPN = S × O × D

Where:
S = Severity (1-10)
O = Occurrence (1-10)
D = Detection (1-10)

Maximum RPN = 10 × 10 × 10 = 1000
Minimum RPN = 1 × 1 × 1 = 1
```

### Cost Impact Equation
Early detection of failures through DFMEA can significantly reduce costs. The relationship between detection time and cost can be approximated as:

```
C = C₀ × e^(kt)

Where:
C = Cost of fixing the failure
C₀ = Base cost of the fix
k = Cost growth rate constant
t = Time delay in detection (competition phases)
```

## 概述
[Previous Chinese overview section with added technical depth in Chinese...]

## DFMEA的原理
DFMEA是一种系统性方法，最初由美国军方在1940年代开发，后被NASA和汽车工业采用。对于FTC机器人团队，DFMEA帮助回答以下关键问题：

- 机器人设计中可能出现什么问题？
- 特定组件失效的后果是什么？
- 在比赛中故障会有多明显？
- 如何在测试中检测故障？
- 如何在影响性能之前预防故障？

### 风险优先数（RPN）计算
RPN通过三个因素计算：

```
RPN = S × O × D

其中：
S = 严重度 (1-10)
O = 发生度 (1-10)
D = 检测度 (1-10)

最大RPN = 10 × 10 × 10 = 1000
最小RPN = 1 × 1 × 1 = 1
```

### 成本影响方程
通过DFMEA早期检测故障可以显著降低成本。检测时间与成本的关系可以近似为：

```
C = C₀ × e^(kt)

其中：
C = 修复故障的成本
C₀ = 基础修复成本
k = 成本增长率常数
t = 检测延迟时间（比赛阶段）
```

## FTC机器人应用
### 重点关注领域
1. **机械系统**

   - 升降机构稳定性
   - 收集系统耐久性
   - 自动运行精度
